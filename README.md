# seo-code-refactor

## This project was to refactor code and make it more usable for accessibilty reasons. The project initially didn't contain very many html semantic tags. The goal was to get those tags changed to what someone or a software would normally expect.

- What was your motivation? Completing the project per the requirements given.
- Why did you build this project? I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of HTML semantics and to show understanding of how certain accessibilty functions could be inhibited if proper tags aren't used.
- What problem does it solve? Having correct or standard HTML semantic tags makes it easier for other people to look at code and decipher what is happening with it. As mentioned prior, having more standard semantic HTML tags makes it more accessible for screen readers and for other accessibilty software.
- What did you learn? I learned about tons of different HTML tags.

## Usage

Provided here is a screenshot of the website. It visually appears the same but the code is more semantic and more friendly to whoever may need to look at the code in the future.
